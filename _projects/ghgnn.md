A hybrid GNN model that predicts infinite dilution activity coefficients at varying temperatures. The [code](https://github.com/edgarsmdn/GH-GNN) contains the training routines and the experiments presented in the paper [Gibbs–Helmholtz graph neural network: capturing the temperature dependency of activity coefficients at infinite dilution](DOI	https://doi.org/10.1039/D2DD00142J).
