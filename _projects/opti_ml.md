A [pedagogical implementation](https://github.com/edgarsmdn/OptML) of the following optimization algorithms used to trained ML models:
* Gradient descent
* Steepest descent
* Gradient descent with momentum
* Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent
* AdaGrad
* AdaDelta
* RMSProp
* Adam
* Newton's method
* Constrained Newton's method
* Barrier method (interior-point methods)
