I served as the main lecturer for this Masters-level (1 semester-long) course introducing chemical engineering students to the field of ML (e.g., linear and generalized linear models, ANNs, kernel methods, hybrid semi-parametric modeling, clustering and dimensionality reduction). As part of the development of this course I lead the development of the (Machine Learning in Chemical Engineering JupyterBook)[https://edgarsmdn.github.io/MLCE_book/intro.html].
Semesters in which I have been the main lecturer:
* Summer semester 2022
* Summer semester 2024
