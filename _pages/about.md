I am currently leading the "Data Intelligence for Systems Engineering (DISE)" team at the [Process Systems Engineering](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/pse) department of the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems. Our research at DISE focuses on four main pillars:

1) Chemical Data Structuring and Infrastructure
2) Data Representations for Systems Engineering
3) Molecular and Mixture Property Prediction
4) Efficient Chemical Space Exploration

In addition to my role at the Max Planck Institute Magdeburg, I am an adjunct lecturer at Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, where I teach Masters-level courses in "Machine Learning in Chemical Engineering" and "Process Systems Engineering."

I hold a Ph.D. from the International Max Planck Research School for Advanced Methods in Process and Systems Engineering (IMPRS ProEng) and the Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg (2024), a M.Sc. in Advanced Chemical Engineering with Process Systems Engineering from Imperial College London (2019) and a B.Eng. in Chemical Engineering from the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) (2018). I have participated in research stays in different labs at Carnegie Mellon University, The University of Manchester, McMaster Unviersity, University of California-Riverside and University of Maryland. I am very grateful for all the support received during my career.

I am also actively involved in outreach activities, was part of the organization team of the [International Meeting of Artificial Intelligence and its Applications (RIIAA)](https://www.riiaa.org/) in Latin America and served as a mentor for the PSE Mexico.
