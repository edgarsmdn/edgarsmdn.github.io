I am currently a Doctoral researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems in the [Process Systems Engineering group](https://www.mpi-magdeburg.mpg.de/pse) led by Prof. Kai Sundmacher. Here, I mainly investigate how graph neural networks can help us create better models for phase equilibria of mixtures and how machine learning can help us selecting better solvents for industry. Also, I research the use of Graph Neural Networks for thermophysical and environmental molecular property prediction and the application of machine learning methods for process optimization. I received my M.Sc. in Advanced Chemical Engineering with Process Systems Engineering from Imperial College London in 2019, and my B.Eng. in Chemical Engineering from UNAM in 2018.
